### Bro, if you are going to run something related to OpenAI (like ChatGPT) in this repo...
We have to setup our own OpenAI API key in our own environment. If we share one key on different laptops, OpenAI will think that this key is leaked and disable it.

Do this by:
1. Create a file called ".Renviron". This file is already marked in .gitignore
2. paste your own API key into this file
